# Fun-With-Websites
A play around with some HTML and Javascript. In this repo are 4 simple games written in an afternoon whilst beginning to learn js and html. Please try them out!  

You can have a play around by either downloading the files or cloning the repo and then opening the start file for each game in a browser.

<h1>The Games:</h1>

1. Crazy Taxi - A popular flash game. It is usually played in a website with loads of ads so i took the liberty to get rid of them and leave only the game.
1. The Hurdle Game allows you to run the hurdles in record breaking time.
1. The Noble and the Peasant is a small skit about being on 2 extremes of the the social ladder.
1. The volatile link is about a portal which will randomly lead you to different worlds.

<h1>Have fun!</h1>
